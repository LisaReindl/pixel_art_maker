# Lisa's Pixel Art Maker

# Introduction
This is a pixel art maker developed for the Udacity Course - Intro to Programming Nanodegree using JavaScript, making some small changes in HTML, whereas HTML and CSS was already given by Udacity.
To making arts, first the player has to choose the grid height and width. After choosing a grid should appear. By selecting the color the next square will be painting in that specific color. 

# Requirements
Making arts by copying the 'index' file into your browser. Have fun! :-)
